# Bomb TS
### A simple bomberman game in typescript
by Isaque Hernandes

## How to setup
First install dependencies running:

```npm install``` 

To run the app, use `npm start`. This command generate JS files and run the server.

To develop I recommend these two scripts:

`npm run server` to start the server and `npm run watch-ts` to watch changes in TS files and rebuild JS files.
