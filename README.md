# Bomb TS
### A simple bomberman game in typescript
by Isaque Hernandes

## How to setup
Install typescript if you don't have:

```npm install -g typescript``` 


Run the typescript config file to generate the javascript files:

`tsc --project tsconfig.json`

The project use javascript modules to separate the code in diferent files. Because of that to run the code locally it's necessary to create a local server. To do there are some libs like [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) or [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).
